### Hangman Game â€“ Python Implementation

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Hangman** word-guessing game, written in Python.

The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses to figure out a hidden word, one letter at a time. With each wrong guess, a part of the hangman is drawn until the game is either won or lost.

### Features
- ASCII-art representation of the hangman
- Customizable number of allowed attempts
- Input validation and user-friendly prompts
- Supports single-player mode via command line

### Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Standard libraries only (no external dependencies)

### Run the Game
To play the game locally, run the main Python script:
```bash
python hangman.py
